This project has a few components that I want to make work. 

## 1. Hero-Matchup Based Drafter
    This tool will be used to enable the user to input the heroes that are being drafted/banned, and then what will return will be hero recommendations for banning or picking, depending on what phase of the draft is happening.

    This requires scraping of dotabuff, which has pages for each hero and their own matchups against other heroes.
